<h2>Hello</h2>
My name is Aidan Reilly. I live in Cork, Ireland. I make music with a small eurorack modular synthesizer. 

This blog is comprised of ideas and snippets related to modular synthesis that I find in books and on the internet. I've been keeping notes for some years, so I figured it was time to start ordering them and putting them somewhere. This site is the result.

You can listen to some sounds of mine on [Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/oootini).
