My name is Aidan Reilly and Iâ€™m a technical writer living in Cork, Ireland. I make music with a small eurorack modular synthesizer. This blog is comprised of ideas and snippets related to modular synthesis that I find on the internet, and in particular on the inestimable [muff-wiggler.com](https://www.muffwiggler.com/forum/) forum. 

Many of the ideas described here are uncredited, this is simply because I kept quick notes on the ideas as i came across them, but not the names of those who suggested them. Where possible, I've tried to retrospectively find sources for the ideas. Please get in touch if you recognise an idea or would like to be credited. I will credit any new ideas that I post, but I have a rather large notebook of content to mine first. Bear with me.</p> 

You can listen to some sounds of mine on [Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/oootini).
