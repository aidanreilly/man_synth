<h2>Hello</h2>
My name is Aidan Reilly and Iâ€™m a technical writer living in Cork, Ireland. I make music with a small eurorack modular synthesizer. 

This blog is comprised of ideas and snippets related to modular synthesis that I find on the internet, and in particular on the inestimable [muff-wiggler.com](https://www.muffwiggler.com/forum/) forum. I've been keeping notes for some years, so I figured it was time to start ordering them and putting them somewhere. This site is the result.

You can listen to some sounds of mine on [Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/oootini).
