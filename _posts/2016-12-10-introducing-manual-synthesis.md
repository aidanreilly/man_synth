Welcome. This is a blog/notebook/website site about patch ideas for modular synthesizers. Occasionally I'll post images and sounds related to those ideas. Most (if not all) of the ideas posted here are culled from various internet blogs and forums, old synth manuals, venerated synthesis tomes, and/or any other scraps of html or pdf I can find.

The "manual" in the title is a reference to the linux man switch to show the manual for a program at the command line. Manual synthesis is my little manual of ideas for modular synthesizers. Patch ideas, strategies, inspiration - anything that can be applied to produce interesting sounds and structures. These notes are recorded for my own edification, as much as for yours. I hope you find them useful.
