Here is a neat idea - put your FM oscillator through a spring reverb to add extra character to the modulation:

{% highlight markdown %}
Mod VCO sine out > Spring reverb  > Primary VCO FM input 
{% endhighlight %}

Some of the usual thing you can do with spring reverbs in the context of modular synthesis apply here too - experiment with adding filters and other signal modifers alongside the spring reverb in the VCO FM signal path.
